ðŸ‘‹ I am Saad, a Datawarrior. My data journey started at {{< staticref "https://www.insa-rennes.fr/" "newtab" >}}INSA Rennes{{< /staticref >}}, where I began the battle. From there, I embarked on a quest to Finland, specifically {{< staticref "https://www.abo.fi/en/" "newtab" >}}Ã…bo Akademi University{{< /staticref >}}, to further hone my skills in the realms of computer science and artificial intelligence. Along the way, I've accumulated a wealth of professional experiences, tackled challenging projects, and embarked on personal internships, molding me into a formidable practitioner in both Data Science and Data Engineering. Now, I stand ready to conquer data-driven battles and unlock the secrets of information realms.
