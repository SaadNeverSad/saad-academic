Most of the state-of-the-art methods applied to time series classification consist of deep learning methods whose output is difficult to explain. This lack of explicability is a major drawback, as many real-world applications involve critical decisions, such as in the medical field. A lot of work has been done in the last few years, but little for time series. This report concludes the ECLAST project, whose objective was the design of an application with a graphical interface capable of representing a time series and visualizing the results of classifiers and counterfactual algorithms and, independently, the design of desired additions to LEFTIST.
